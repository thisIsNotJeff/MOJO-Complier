# COMP3710 Lab 1---Lexical Analysis: Scanner

## Description

Please refer to https://cs.anu.edu.au/courses/comp3710-compilers/labs/p1/ .

## Build

Run `make` to build and run `make clean` to clean Java bytecode or
object files.

## Test

Run `./grade.sh` at the root of the repository.  You can append
`-make` to the command so that the project is built before running the
test.  You can give `-color` to the command as the **LAST** option so
that you get color-coded outputs for the tests that pass or fail.
